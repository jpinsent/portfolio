## About

I'm a University of Guelph student in the final year of my Bachelor of Computing degree. I am an aspiring game developer, but I also have experience in web development, analytics, and web content accessibility. I am very passionate about programming and will be looking for work opportunities starting in January 2018.  

In my work term at Adknown, I developed and published several games to the Google Play Store and the iTunes App Store. Rockslide, Super Grapple, Sword Spinner, and King of Sling are a few of the titles I developed for Adknown. All of these games were developed in Unity with C#, and some of them have received over ten thousand installs.  

When I worked for Computing and Communication Services at the University of Guelph, I remediated and launched Drupal websites to conform to Web Content Accessibility 2.0 guidelines. I coached other Co-Op students on accessibility and became extremely familiar with front-end and back-end Drupal management. I also developed automated unit tests using Selenium to speed up the remediation process.
