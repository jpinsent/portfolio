## About

I am a graduate from the School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph. I received my Bachelor of Computing degree in 2018 and I am currently working as a Software Engineer for Electronic Arts in Montreal. I am very passionate about programming. My area of focus is in game development, but I also have experience in tool development, web development, analytics, and web content accessibility. 

In my time working as a Mobile Game Developer at Adknown, I developed and published several games to the Google Play Store and the iTunes App Store. Rockslide, Super Grapple, Sword Spinner, and King of Sling are a few of the titles I developed for Adknown. All of these games were developed in Unity with C#, and some of them have received over ten thousand installs.
